      <p>Howdy I'm Nathan Garvie and I am Canadian living in 'Murica. I design products at Facebook and used to run a design and research agency in Toronto called Heist with a bunch of really cool people.</p>
      <p>I hang out on Twitter, post on IG and write on Medium every once and while.</p>

      <p>I've been lucky to have the opportunity to tackle some really massive problems. I've rethought homebuying for Canadians. Assembled an awesome team of designers, researchers and strategists. Built a telco experience that puts people first. Taught people how to think and work as product designers. Now I'm helping people all over the world find each other more than 1.5 billion times a day.</p>

      <p>You should follow my adorable fucking dog. I will live to see the Maple Leafs lift the Stanley Cup. I'm happiest with my face in a bowl of ramen.</p>
